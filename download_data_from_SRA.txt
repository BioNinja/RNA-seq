## Accessing the ‘ascp’ utility.

As of version 3.3x of Aspera Connect, the default install location for ascp is:

* Microsoft Windows: ‘C:\Program Files\Aspera\Aspera Connect\bin\ascp.exe’

* Mac OS X: ‘/Applications/Aspera Connect.app/Contents/Resources/ascp’ (Administrator-installed Aspera Connect) or ‘/Users/[username]/Applications/Aspera\ Connect.app/Contents/Resources/ascp’ (Non-administrator install)

* Linux: ‘/opt/aspera/bin/ascp’ or ‘/home/[username]/.aspera/connect/bin/ascp’


3. install sra-tools 

	conda install -c bioconda sra-tools

4. downlaod 

You need two file:

    1. The ascp executable binary, which is probably in $HOME/.aspera/connect/bin/ascp
    2. The ascp ssh key, which is probably in $HOME/.aspera/connect/etc/asperaweb_id_dsa.openssh
 
 Now you can use asco with either prefetch or fastq dump.
 Try this command. You need a pipe between the two file names above, but you should now get much faster downloads!

    prefetch --ascp-path "/Users/bioninja/.aspera/connect/bin/ascp|/Users/bioninja/.aspera/connect/etc/asperaweb_id_dsa.openssh" SRR1982614
